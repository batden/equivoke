# equivoke

This set of bash scripts will build, install, and update the Enlightenment environment on your system.

Please read the comments of equivoke.sh for hints and additional information.

## Installation

Before using equivoke, you may need to install the git package on your system if it isn't already there.

Open a terminal window and type in the following:

```bash
sudo apt install git
```

Next, clone the repository with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/batden/equivoke.git .equivoke
```

This creates a new hidden folder named .equivoke in your home directory.

Copy the equivoke.sh file from the new .equivoke folder to your download folder.

Navigate to the download folder and make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x equivoke.sh
```

Then, execute the script:

```bash
./equivoke.sh
```

To run it again later, just open a terminal and type:

```bash
equivoke.sh
```
 Use auto-completion: Type _equ_ and press the Tab key.

That's it.

## Uninstallation

You can uninstall Enlightenment and related applications from your computer at any time.

To do so, run the script and select option 4 from the menu.
